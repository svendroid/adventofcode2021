# Advent of Code 2021

This year I want to improve my kotlin skills. Maybe use the puzzles to explore new features in kotlin.

What did I learn?

## Day 1

* project setup of a simple kotlin project
* `com.willowtreeapps.assertk:assertk-jvm:0.25` is the lib I use for unit tests all the time at work. Needed to import
  it.
* Array methods: `copyRanged` and `mapIndexed`

## Day 2

* I like `String#trimMargin()` to format input strings nicely in the tests.

## Day 3

* Feels like a dirty solution :) Probably should have used some kind of bitwise-operator or so.
* I liked the recursive part.
